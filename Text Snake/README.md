# Text Based Snake

This was just a project to help me learn Python more in depth. I also wanted to learn multi threading so I included that in this project. The code uses only Arrays and 2 loops running at different speeds on seperate threads to draw a snake to the screen and play the snake game with keyboard inputs.

## Inputs

Arrow keys to move
q to quit game after loss
r restart after game loss
